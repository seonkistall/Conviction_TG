# Conviction — Frontend (v2)

The first **Asia-native, AI-powered prediction market**. Every market is
a "living card": immersive video of the actual narrative auto-plays in-line
(K-pop MV, LCK highlight, KBO swing, crypto B-roll), and Conviction layers
on the things a prediction market for Asia actually needs:

- a **TikTok-style vertical feed** tuned for mobile-first APAC traffic,
- **multi-outcome markets + parlays** so you can stack cultural theses,
- a **Conviction Oracle** pipeline with 23 scrapers, evidence bundles, and
  agentic traders you can copy-trade live on-chain, and
- **Asia-native moats** — a Narrative Index suite, a K-Culture Debut Radar,
  and a cultural-sentiment Vibe Meter — wrapped in a bilingual UI
  (English default, Korean toggle).

## Stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router, server components where sensible)
- **TypeScript** (strict)
- **Tailwind CSS** — custom Conviction palette (`ink`, `bone`, `volt`, `conviction`, `yes`/`no`)
- **Zero external state manager** — React Context + `useReducer` for parlay,
  mute, and i18n. localStorage / sessionStorage / cookies for persistence.
- **Zero chart deps** — sparklines, conic-gradient dials, and the price area
  chart are all hand-rolled SVG.
- Fonts: Inter + Instrument Serif + JetBrains Mono.

No database, no auth — all data is mocked in `lib/markets.ts` so you can
clone, `npm install`, `npm run dev`, and see the full product end-to-end.

## Getting started

```bash
cd conviction-fe
npm install

## v2 highlights (what Conviction ships)

### Vertical Feed (`/feed`)
Full-bleed `100dvh` cards with CSS scroll-snap (`snap-feed` utility). Each
card is a `<FeedCard>` with right-rail social actions (like, comment,
**+ Parlay**, share), an IntersectionObserver tracks the active card, and the
global Mute FAB can unmute the whole feed with one tap. Binary markets show
inline YES/NO buttons; multi-outcome markets show the `OutcomeBar` strip.

### Multi-outcome markets + parlays
- `Market.kind` is `'binary' | 'multi'`. Multi markets carry an `outcomes[]`
  with colors and implied probs.
- `OutcomeBar` renders a stacked probability strip + click-to-pick buttons.
  Every pick dispatches `parlay.add({ marketId, pick, price })`.
- `ParlaySlip` is a global drawer (bottom-sheet on mobile, right-rail on
  desktop). Combined multiplier = `1 / Π price_i`, max payout = stake ×
  multiplier. Stake presets at $10 / $25 / $100 / $500. Persisted in
  localStorage under `cv_parlay_v1`.

### Edge badges
When `Market.edgePP >= 5`, `<EdgeBadge>` shows the Conviction AI mispricing
delta inline on cards and the market detail. This is the visible "AI alpha
you can see" moat.

### Conviction Oracle + Evidence Bundle
`AIOracleCard` on every market detail exposes:
- Model (Qwen3-32B draft → Sonnet-4.6 verify).
- Confidence and direction vs. the market price.
- An **Inspect evidence bundle** button that opens `EvidenceSideSheet` — a
  right-side drawer with the full source list (provider, confidence dot,
  excerpt, retrieved-at timestamp).

### AI Market Wizard (`/markets/new`)
Typing a question streams a 6-phase agent pipeline on screen:
`idle → parse → route → scrape → judge → verify → publish → done`. Each
phase swaps a detail panel: parsed entities, the domain router (e.g.
`stack.kpop.v3`), the 13-scraper swarm, Qwen3's draft verdict, Sonnet's
cross-check, and a mock HOGC oracle publish receipt.

### Asia-native moats

- **Narrative Indices** — curated weighted baskets ("K-Pop Big 4 · FY26",
  "LCK Dominance Index", "Hallyu Goes Global") priced in ¢ with legs + weights.
- **Agentic Traders** — marketplace of AI quants (Conviction-v2, Allora-KR,
  Qwen3-32B, Sonnet-4.6). 30-day PnL, win rate, AUM, followers. Live dot
  when the bot is on-chain right now.
- **Vibe Meter** — cultural sentiment signals from Weverse / X / Instiz /
  Reddit / YouTube. Per-topic 0–100 score + 24-point sparkline + source tints.
- **K-Culture Debut Calendar** — horizontally scrolling timeline of HYBE /
  SM / YG / JYP / ADOR comebacks with heat bars and a "Create market" /
  "View market" CTA per event.

### i18n (EN / KO)
Light-weight: no `next-intl`, no JSON fetch. `lib/i18n.tsx` ships two
dictionaries (EN + KO) and a Context provider. `<LangToggle>` in the header
persists the choice to cookie `cv_lang`. About 70 keys covered across nav,
hero, market card, parlay, feed, oracle, wizard, and moat components.

### Global Mute FAB
Bottom-left FAB toggles audio on every on-screen `<video>`. Browser autoplay
policy still requires videos to start muted; after the first user tap the
provider walks the DOM and unmutes everything at once. State persists to
sessionStorage under `cv_mute`.

## v2.13 — Live ticker + ⌘K palette

### Real-time price tick simulation (`lib/livePrices.tsx`)
A single React Context owns a tick loop and exposes `useLivePrices(ids, seeds)`
that returns a `Record<id, number>` of current marks. The provider emits a
small Brownian step every ~1.4s for any subscribed market, scoped by an
`ids` array so off-screen markets don't waste CPU. Seeds keep the first paint
deterministic — the ticker hasn't fired yet on hydrate.

### ⌘K command palette (`CommandPalette.tsx`)
Global keyboard-first navigator. `⌘K` (or `Ctrl+K`, or `/` outside text
fields) opens a dialog with a fuzzy-scored search across markets, narratives,
and traders. The match scorer NFC-normalizes the query so a Hangul needle
like `중국` hits Hangul titles cleanly — guarded by a Playwright smoke test.

## v2.14 — CI + OG pixel regression

### Playwright in CI
GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (currently held back
by a PAT scope upgrade — see commit log) runs the full chromium smoke suite
on every PR + push to `main`. Caches `~/.cache/ms-playwright` keyed on the
`@playwright/test` lockfile entry so cold installs only happen on version
bumps.

### OG image pixel regression (`tests/og.spec.ts`)
The Satori renderer behind `next/og` silently drops elements when it hits
unsupported flex rules or a missing font glyph — the image keeps shipping,
just blank where the broken piece was. We hit a representative set of OG
endpoints (one market per K/J/C region + two trader personas), render the
PNG into a centered `<img>` element, and diff against a checked-in baseline
in `tests/og.spec.ts-snapshots/`. Tolerance is `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.05` —
wider than the 2% typical for raster diffs because `next/og` fetches glyphs
at request time and a fallback font swap can swing pixels a few percent.
Real breakages (missing card, dropped Hangul, empty title) always exceed 5%.

Re-baseline on a deliberate layout change with:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/og.spec.ts --project=chromium --update-snapshots
```

The suite is default-on. Set `OG_SNAPSHOTS=0` to opt out in environments
where outbound font fetches are blocked entirely.

## v2.15 — Batched live ticker for every grid

### `LiveMarketGrid` wrapper
The v2.13 `useLivePrices` ticker shipped on portfolio Hot Positions only.
v2.15 routes every market grid in the app — `CategoryTabs`, `/leaderboard`,
`/markets/[id]` related, `/narratives/[slug]`, `/worlds-2026` — through a
single `<LiveMarketGrid markets={...}>` wrapper that opens **one**
`useLivePrices(ids, seeds)` subscription per visible grid and feeds each
card its current mark via the new `MarketCard` `livePrice` prop.

Why a wrapper instead of making `MarketCard` a client component:

- `MarketCard` renders from server pages (leaderboard, worlds-2026, market
  detail). Promoting it to `"use client"` would force a giant client tree,
  hurting LCP and bundle size.
- One subscription per visible grid scales better than one per card if a
  future page renders 100+ markets.

For pages that need a per-card overlay (e.g. the `% leg` chip on
`/narratives/[slug]`), pass a `decorators?: Record<id, ReactNode>` prop —
plain ReactNodes serialize across the server-to-client boundary, so server
pages can hand them in without a `"use client"` directive.

## Video sourcing

Hybrid, matching the product direction:

1. **`mp4`** — short royalty-free culture/sport B-roll from Pexels. In
   production these would move to the Conviction CDN (Mux or Cloudflare
   Stream) for licensed footage.
2. **`youtube`** — official video IDs rendered via `youtube-nocookie.com`
   embeds with `autoplay=1&mute=1&loop=1&playlist=<id>` so K-pop MVs and
   LCK highlights play inline without third-party cookies.

`AutoVideo` decides which renderer to use based on `media.kind`, lazy-mounts
with IntersectionObserver, and cooperates with the global Mute provider.

## What would change in production

- Real order book + AMM, not the 9-row mock in `OrderBook`.
- Real WebSocket price + trade stream (the "Live · websocket" label).
- Replace the `SCRAPERS` array + setTimeout pipeline with the actual
  ResearchSwarm backend (Qwen3 / Sonnet + 23 real retrievers).
- Sign-in, wallet connect, and on-chain settlement via HOGC oracle.
- Licensed media CDN.
- Full translations beyond the ~70 strings currently bilingual.
